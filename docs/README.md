<!-- I rewrote this page to be more of a hub page, with links to the most helpful sections in the docs. Obviously, I don't know exactly what these sections would be yet, but I picked a few that seemed important. Also, I'm not 100% confident in the html/markdown formatting (I used the docs I created at Sauce Labs as a starting point), so I hope it's clear enough to get the idea.-->

# Overview

Coder is an open-source platform for creating and managing developer workspaces
on your preferred clouds and servers.

By building on top of common development interfaces (such as SSH) and infrastructure tools (such as Terraform), Coder makes the process of **provisioning** and **accessing** remote workspaces approachable for organizations of various sizes and stages of cloud-native maturity.
